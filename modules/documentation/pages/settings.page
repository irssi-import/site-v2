<h3>[completion]</h3>
<dl>

<dt>completion_strict = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When on, nicknames are matched strictly.  That is, the partial
    nickname you enter must be at the beginning of a nickname in one
    of irssi's lists.
</dd>
<dd>
    When off, irssi will first try a strict match.  If a strict match
    can't be found, irssi will look for nicknames that match when
    their leading non-alphanumeric characters are removed.  For
    example:
	<pre><code>vis: hello</code></pre>

</dd>
<dd>
    With strict completion on, it will only match nicknames beginning
    with &quot;vis&quot;.  With strict completion off, it may match &quot;visitors&quot;
    or &quot;_visitors_&quot; or &quot;[visitors]&quot;, and so on.
</dd>

<dt>completion_keep_privates = 10</dt>
<dd>
    Irssi keeps a list of nicknames from private messages to search
    during nick completion.  This setting determines how many
    nicknames are held.
</dd>
<dd>
    TODO - Is this list maintained by people who privately message
    you, who you privately message, or both?
</dd>

<dt>completion_char = :</dt>
<dd>
    The text that irssi puts after a tab-completed nickname, or that
    it uses to detect nicknames when you have completion_auto turned
    on.  Some people alter this to colorize the completion character,
    creating the oft-dreaded &quot;bold colon&quot;.

</dd>

<dt>completion_auto = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Tell irssi to detect incomplete nicknames in your input and look
    up their completions automatically.  Incomplete nicknames are
    detected when you input text that matches
    /^(\S+)${completion_character}/.  For example:
	<pre><code>vis: hello</code></pre>
	will be expanded to<br />
	<pre><code>visitors: hello</code></pre>
    when you press enter.  So will:
	<pre><code>vis:hello
Vis::Hello(12);</code></pre>

    This will eventually bite you.
</dd>

<dt>completion_nicks_lowercase = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When enabled, irssi forces completed nicknames to lowercase.
    Manually typed nicknames retain their case.
</dd>

<dt>completion_keep_publics = 50</dt>
<dd>
    Irssi keeps a list of nicknames from public messages to search
    during nick completion.  This setting determines how many
    nicknames are held.
</dd>

<dd>
    TODO - Is this list maintained by watching who you speak to, who
    speak to you, or both?
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>[dcc]</h3>

<dl>
<dt>dcc_autorename = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Turn on this setting to automatically rename received files so
    they don't overwrite existing files.
</dd>
<dd>

    I think this setting may thwart dcc_autoresume, since the
    auto-resume feature looks for existing filenames when resuming.
    Auto-renaming downloads makes sure that filenames never conflict,
    so resuming is not possible.
</dd>

<dt>dcc_autoresume = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When on, dcc_autoresume will cause irssi to look for existing
    files with the same name as a new DCC transfer.  If a file already
    exists by that name, irssi will try to resume the transfer by
    appending any new data to the existing file.
</dd>
<dd>
    I think this option clashes with dcc_autorename.  See
    dcc_autorename for more information.
</dd>
<dd>
    Dcc_autoresume is ignored if dcc_autoget is off.

</dd>

<dt>dcc_timeout = 5min</dt>
<dd>
    How long to keep track of pending DCC requests.  Requests that do
    not receive responses within this time will be automatically
    canceled.
</dd>

<dt>dcc_autoget = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Turn DCC auto-get on or off.  When on, irssi will attempt to
    auto-get files sent to you.
</dd>
<dd>    
    This feature can be abused, so it is usually off by default.  If
    you enable it, consider also setting dcc_autoget_masks and
    dcc_autoget_max_size to make this feature more secure.

</dd>

<dt>dcc_upload_path = ~</dt>
<dd>
    The path where you keep public files available to send via DCC.
</dd>

<dt>dcc_autoget_masks =</dt>
<dd>
    Set dcc_autoget_masks with user masks to automatically accept
    files sent to you via DCC.  When unset, irssi's auto-get settings
    will work for everyone who attempts to send you files.
</dd>
<dd>
    This setting is only significant if dcc_autoget is ON.

</dd>

<dt>dcc_autoget_max_size = 0k</dt>
<dd>
    Set to nonzero to limit the size of files that irssi will
    auto-get.
</dd>
<dd>
    Note: Because of the way DCC works, someone may advertise a file
    at once size but try to send you something larger.  According to
    src/irc/dcc/dcc-autoget.c, this only filters the request based on
    the advertised size.
</dd>
<dd>
    This setting is only significant if dcc_autoget is ON.
</dd>

<dt>dcc_send_replace_space_with_underscore = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When enabled, irssi will replace spaces with underscores in the
    names of files you send.  It should only be necessary when sending
    files to clients that don't support quoted filenames, or if you
    hate spaces in filenames.
</dd>

<dt>dcc_own_ip =</dt>
<dd>
    Set dcc_own_ip to force irssi to always send DCC requests from a
    particular virtual host (vhost).  Irssi will always bind sockets
    to this address when answering DCC requests.  Otherwise irssi will
    determine your IP address on its own.
</dd>

<dt>dcc_download_path = ~</dt>
<dd>

    The path to a directory where irssi will store DCC downloads.
</dd>

<dt>dcc_file_create_mode = 644</dt>
<dd>
    The mode in which new files are created.
</dd>
<dd>
      644 is read/write by you, and readable by everybody else.  600
      is read/write by you, nobody else can read or write.
</dd>

<dt>dcc_port = 0</dt>

<dd>
    The smallest port number that irssi will use when initiating DCC
    requests.  Irssi picks a port at random when this is set to zero.
</dd>
<dd>
    dcc_port can be two ports, separated by a space.  In that case,
    irssi will pick a port between the two numbers, inclusively.  For
    example:
	<pre><code>/set dcc_port 10000 20000</code></pre>
</dd>

<dt>dcc_autochat_masks =</dt>
<dd>
    Set dcc_autochat_masks with user masks to auto-accept chat
    requests from.  When unset, irssi's auto-accept settings work for
    everyone who tries to DCC chat you.  The drawbacks can range from
    annoying through downright dangerous.  Use auto-accept with care.
</dd>

<dt>dcc_mirc_ctcp = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Tells irssi to send CTCP messages that are compatible with mIRC
    clients.  This lets you use &quot;/me&quot; actions in DCC chats with mIRC
    users, among other things.
</dd>

<dt>dcc_autoaccept_lowports = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When this setting is OFF, irssi will not auto-accept DCC requests
    from privileged ports (those below 1024) even when auto-accept is
    otherwise on.
</dd>

</dl>

<h3>[flood]</h3>

<dl>
<dt>autoignore_time = 5min</dt>
<dd>
    Irssi can auto-ignore people who are flooding.  autoignore_time
    sets the amount of time to keep someone ignored.  Irssi will
    automatically unignore them after this period of time has elapsed.
</dd>

<dt>autoignore_level =</dt>
<dd>
    The type or types of messages that will trigger auto-ignore.

</dd>

<dt>flood_max_msgs = 4<br />
  flood_timecheck = 8</dt>
<dd>
    Irssi will treat text as flooding if more than flood_max_msgs
    messages are received during flood_timecheck seconds.  In the case
    above, five or more messages matching autoignore_level over the
    course of eight seconds will trigger flood protection.  See
    autoignore_time to set the amount of time someone will remain
    ignored if it's determined that they're flooding.
</dd>

<dt>cmds_max_at_once = 5</dt>
<dd>
    How many commands you can send immediately before server-side
    flood protection starts.

</dd>
<dd>
    IRC servers also perform flood checking, and they will gleefully
    disconnect you if you are abusing them.  The cmds_max_at_once
    setting lets irssi know how many rapid messages it can get away
    with while remaining under the IRC server's radar.
</dd>

<dt>cmd_queue_speed = 2200msec</dt>
<dd>
    The time to wait between sending commands to an IRC server.  Used
    to prevent irssi from flooding you off if you must auto-kick/ban
    lots of people at once.
</dd>

<dt>max_ctcp_queue = 5</dt>
<dd>
    The maximum number of pending CTCP requests to keep.  Requests
    beyond max_ctcp_queue will be discarded.

</dd>
</dl>

<h3>[history]</h3>

<dl>
<dt>scrollback_save_formats = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Turn on to save formats in the scrollback buffer, so that old
    messages are not changed by new themes.  Turn off so the current
    theme applies to your entire scrollback buffer.
</dd>
<dd>
    Setting this to OFF doesn't seem to do anything, however.
</dd>

<dt>scroll_page_count = /2</dt>
<dd>
    How many pages to scroll the scrollback buffer when pressing
    page-up or page-down.  Expressed as a number of lines, or as a
    fraction of the screen:
	<pre>/2  = Scroll half a page.
.33 = Scroll about a third of a page.
4   = Scroll four lines.</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
    <a href="http://bugs.irssi.org/index.php?do=details&amp;id=254">http://bugs.irssi.org/index.php?do=details&amp;id=254</a> contains a
    patch thet lets you specify a negative number to scroll &quot;all but
    this many&quot; lines.  That is, -1 will scroll a full page minus one
    line, for people who like that.

</dd>

<dt>window_history = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When turned ON, command history will be kept per-window.  When
    off, irssi uses a single command history for all windows.
</dd>

<dt>max_command_history = 100</dt>
<dd>
    The number of lines of your own input to keep for recall.
</dd>

<dt>scrollback_time = 1day</dt>

<dd>
    Keep at least scrollback_time worth of messages in the scrollback
    buffer, even if it means having more than scrollback_lines lines
    in the buffer.
</dd>

<dt>rawlog_lines = 200</dt>
<dd>
    Irssi's raw log is a buffer of raw IRC messages.  It's used for
    debugging irssi and maybe some other things.  This setting tells
    irssi how many raw messages to keep around.
</dd>

<dt>scrollback_lines = 500</dt>
<dd>
    The maximum number of messages to keep in your scrollback history.
    Set to 0 if you don't want to limit scrollback by a line count.
    The scrollback_time setting will be used even if scrollback_lines
    is zero.

</dd>
<dd>
    Setting scrollback_lines to zero also seems to thwart the
    scrollback_burst_remove optimization.
</dd>

<dt>scrollback_burst_remove = 10</dt>
<dd>
    This is a speed optimization: Don't bother removing messages from
    the scrollback buffer until the line limit has been exceeded by
    scrollback_burst_remove lines.  This lets irssi do its memory
    management in chunks rather than one line at a time.
</dd>
<dd>
    TODO - Is this right?
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>[log]</h3>

<dl>
<dt>log_close_string = --- Log closed %a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y</dt>
<dd>
    The message to log when logs are closed.
</dd>
<dd>
    See Appendix C for the meanings of Irssi's time format codes.
</dd>

<dt>log_timestamp = %H:%M</dt>

<dd>
    The time format for log timestamps.
</dd>
<dd>
    See Appendix C for the meanings of Irssi's time format codes.
</dd>

<dt>autolog_colors = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Whether to save colors in autologs.  Colors make logs harder to
    parse and grep, but they may be vital for channels that deal
    heavily in ANSI art, or something.
</dd>

<dt>autolog_level = all -crap -clientcrap -ctcps</dt>

<dd>
    The types of messages to auto-log.  See the autolog setting.
</dd>

<dt>awaylog_colors = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Whether to store color information in /away logs.
</dd>

<dt>log_day_changed = --- Day changed %a %b %d %Y</dt>
<dd>
    The message to log when a new day begins.

</dd>
<dd>
    See Appendix C for the meanings of Irssi's time format codes.
</dd>

<dt>autolog = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Automatically log everything, or at least the types of messages
    defined by autolog_level.</dd>
<dt>autolog_path = ~/irclogs/$tag/$0.log</dt>
<dd>
    The path where autolog saves logs.</dd>

<dd>
    See Appendix B for Irssi's special variables.  Irssi's special
    variables can be used to do fancy things like daily log rotations.
</dd>

<dt>awaylog_level = msgs hilight</dt>
<dd>
    The types of messages to log to awaylog_file while you're away.
</dd>

<dt>awaylog_file = ~/.irssi/away.log</dt>
<dd>
    Where to log messages while you're away.</dd>

<dd>
    I assume irssi's special variables also work here.  See Appendix B
    for more information about them.
</dd>

<dt>log_theme =</dt>
<dd>
    Logs can have a different theme than what you see on the screen.
    This can be used to create machine-parseable versions of logs, for
    example.
</dd>

<dt>log_create_mode = 600</dt>
<dd>
    The permissions to use when creating log files.</dd>

<dd>
    600 is read/write by you, but nobody else can see them.  A
    sensible default mode.  It can also be set to 644 if you want the
    rest of the world to read your logs.
</dd>

<dt>log_open_string = --- Log opened %a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y</dt>
<dd>
    The message to log when a log is opened.</dd>
<dd>
    See Appendix C for the meanings of Irssi's time format codes.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>[lookandfeel]</h3>

<dl>
<dt>show_names_on_join = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Display the list of names in a channel when you join that channel.
    It's generally recommended, but you can disable it for
    pathologically huge channels or in case you just don't care.
</dd>

<dt>window_check_level_first = OFF<br />
  window_default_level = NONE</dt>
<dd>

    From irssi's ChangeLog:</dd>
<dd>
    Added /SET window_check_level_first and /SET window_default_level.
    This allows you to keep all messages with specific level in it's
    own window, even if it was supposed to be printed in channel
    window.  patch by mike@po.cs.msu.su</dd>
<dd>
    Try to choose better the window where we print when matching by
    level and multiple windows have a match.  Should fix problems with
    query windows with a default msgs window + /SET
    window_check_level_first ON.</dd>
<dd>
    Wouter Coekaerts has made a nice explanation about this, see
    <a href="http://wouter.coekaerts.be/site/irssi/wclf">http://wouter.coekaerts.be/site/irssi/wclf</a>
</dd>

<dt>emphasis = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Enable or disable real underlining and bolding when someone says
    *bold* or _underlined_.
</dd>

<dt>autocreate_split_windows = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Automatically created windows will be created as split windows
    with this setting on.</dd>
<dd>
    Split windows are the kind where multiple windows are on one
    screen.

</dd>

<dt>beep_msg_level =</dt>
<dd>
    Beep when messages match this level mask.
</dd>

<dt>actlist_moves = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When on, irssi rearranges the activity list so windows with more
    recent activity appear first.  Otherwise windows are listed in
    numeric order.
</dd>

<dt>hilight_nick_matches = ON</dt>

<dd>
    Tell irssi whether it should automatically highlight text that
    matches your nickname.
</dd>

<dt>emphasis_multiword = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Turn on to allow *more than one word bold* and _multiple
    underlined words_.  Used in conjunction with the emphasis setting.
</dd>

<dt>hide_colors = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Hide mIRC and ANSI colors when turned on.  This can be used to
    eliminate &quot;angry fruit salad&quot; syndrome in some channels.

</dd>

<dt>names_max_width = 0</dt>
<dd>
    Maximum number of columns to consume with a /names listing.
    Overrides names_max_columns if non-zero.  Set to 0 for &quot;as many as
    fit in your terminal&quot;.
</dd>

<dt>mirc_blink_fix = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Some terminals interpret bright background colors as blinking
    text.  mIRC doesn't support blinking at all.  This fixes the
    blinky terminals by replacing high colors with their low
    equivalents.</dd>

<dd>
    From irssi's ChangeLog:
    <blockquote>
      <p>/SET mirc_blink_fix - if ON, the bright/blink bit is stripped
      from MIRC colors. Set this to ON, if your terminal shows bright
      background colors as blinking.</p>
	</blockquote>
</dd>

<dt>autoclose_windows = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Automatically close windows when nobody is in them.  This keeps
    your window list tidy, but it means that query windows may
    rearrange as people log off then privately message you later.
</dd>

<dt>bell_beeps = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Tell irssi whether bell characters (chr 7, ^G) should actually
    cause beeps.</dd>
<dd>
    According to Nei, bell_beeps seems to cover the case where a beep
    is caused by a printed message/format.  It's unrelated to activity
    beeps.
</dd>

<dt>hide_server_tags = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Server tags are prefixes to some messages (server messages?) that
    let you know which server the message came from.  They're often
    considered noisy, so this option lets you hide them.

</dd>

<dt>show_nickmode = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Prefix nicknames with their channel status:
	  <pre><code>voiced  +
      half-op %
      op      @</code></pre>
</dd>

<dt>theme = default</dt>
<dd>
    Irssi supports themes that can change most of the client's look
    and feel.  This setting lets you name the theme you wish to use.
</dd>

<dt>timestamps = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Turn timestamps on or off.  When off, not even timestamp_level
    will trigger them.
</dd>

<dt>indent = 10</dt>
<dd>
    How many columns to indent subsequent lines of a wrapped message.</dd>
<dd>
    Attention: This can be overwritten by themes.

</dd>

<dt>timestamp_format = %H:%M</dt>
<dd>
    How to format the time used in timestamps.</dd>
<dd>
    See Appendix C for the meanings of Irssi's time format codes.
</dd>

<dt>activity_msg_level = PUBLIC</dt>
<dd>
    Flag a channel as active when messages of this type are displayed
    there.

</dd>

<dt>print_active_channel = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Always print the channel with the nickname (like &lt;nick:channel&gt;)
    even if the message is from the channel you currently have active.
</dd>

<dt>autoclose_query = 0</dt>
<dd>
    Automatically close query windows after autoclose_query seconds of
    inactivity.  Setting autoclose_query to zero will keep them open
    until you decide to close them yourself.
</dd>

<dt>activity_hide_targets =</dt>
<dd>
    Sometimes you don't care at all about a channel's activity.  This
    can be set to a list of channels that will never appear to be
    active.
</dd>

<dt>use_msgs_window = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Use a single window for all private messages.  This setting only
    makes sense if automatic query windows is turned off.
</dd>

<dt>timestamp_timeout = 0</dt>

<dd>
    The amount of time to leave timestamps on after a timestamp_level
    message triggered timestamping.  Useful for people who think
    timestamps are noisy but would like timestamps for important
    conversations.
</dd>

<dt>use_status_window = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Create a separate window for all server status messages, so they
    don't clutter up your channels.
</dd>

<dt>windows_auto_renumber = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Closing windows can create gaps in the window list.  When
    windows_auto_renumber is turned on, however, windows are shifted
    to lower numbers in the list to fill those gaps.

</dd>

<dt>show_nickmode_empty = ON</dt>
<dd>
    If a person has no chanel modes, prefix their nickname with a
    blank space.  This keeps nicknames of normal people aligned with
    those of voiced, half-opped, and opped people.
</dd>

<dt>beep_when_away = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Should beeps be noisy when you're /away?  Great for people who
    sleep near their terminals or keep irssi running at work. :)
</dd>

<dt>timestamp_level = ALL</dt>

<dd>
    Types of messages to prefix a timestamp to.  Useful for explicit
    or automatic timestamps.</dd>
<dd>
    Once timestamping is temporarily turned on, it may stay on for
    timestamp_timeout seconds.
</dd>

<dt>indent_always = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Should we indent the long words that are forcibly wrapped to the
    next line?  This can break long &quot;words&quot; such as URLs by inserting
    spaces in the middle of them.</dd>

<dd>
    Turn off if you would like to copy/paste or otherwise use URLs
    from your terminal.
</dd>

<dt>hilight_color = %Y</dt>
<dd>
    The default color for /hilight.
</dd>
<dd>
    See Appendix D for Irssi's color codes.
</dd>

<dt>emphasis_replace = OFF</dt>

<dd>
    If emphasis is turned on, the * or _ characters indicating
    emphasis will be removed when the word is made bold or underlined.
    Some people find this looks cleaner.</dd>
<dd>
    See the emphasis setting for more information.
</dd>

<dt>hilight_level = PUBLIC DCCMSGS</dt>

    See Appendix D for Irssi's color codes.
</dd>

<dt>expand_escapes = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Detect escapes in input, and expand them to the characters they
    describe.  For example
	<pre><code>\t</code></pre>

    tab character (chr 9) when expand_escapes is on.
</dd>

<dt>autocreate_windows = ON</dt>
<dd>

    messages.
</dd>

<dt>term_auto_detach = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Automatically detach from the terminal when it disappears.</dd>
<dd>
    This doesn't actually work.  Or if it does, there's currently no
    way to re-attach to the terminal.  It may be useful for setting up
    daemons where you don't want to run nohup or screen, however.
</dd>

<dt>hide_text_style = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Hide bold, blink, underline, and reverse attributes.

</dd>

    on channel join.  Set to 0 for &quot;as many as fit in your terminal&quot;.
</dd>

<dt>chanmode_expando_strip = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When on, $M will not return mode parameters.</dd>
<dd>
    This means for example that the channel limit and channel key
    won't be shown in your statusbar (a common place where $M is used)
    (but also not in all other places that refer to $M for whatever
    reason).

</dd>

<dt>show_quit_once = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When turned on, a quit message will only be shown once.  Otherwise

<dd>
    Turn on to automatically create query windows when you /msg
    someone.
</dd>

    into consideration when it needs to delete multibyte characters,
    for example.</dd>
<dd>
    A common value is utf-8 for Unicode/UTF-8 enabled terminals.</dd>
<dd>
    TODO - Does this still support Chinese terminal emulators? (Used

</dd>

<dt>activity_hilight_level = MSGS DCCMSGS</dt>
<dd>
    There are times when you want to highlight channel activity in a
    window.  Like when someone sends you a private message, or a DCC
    message.  Activity_highlight_level sets the kind of messages you
    think are extra important.
</dd>

<dt>autostick_split_windows = ON</dt>
<dd>
    TODO - What is this?</dd>
<dd>
    Nei says:  Setting split windows to stick means that their content
    won't change.  Best thing to come up with a viable description
    might be if you tried it.</dd>

<dd>
    f0rked has written <a href="http://f0rked.com/articles/irssisplit">an excellent guide to irssi's split windows</a>.
</dd>

<dt>query_track_nick_changes = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Query windows will track nick changes when this is on.  That is,

    unknown nick.</dd>
<dd>
    TODO - Really?
</dd>

<dt>scroll = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Set scroll ON to have irssi scroll your screen when it fills up.
    Set it OFF to require manual scrolling.</dd>
<dd>
    Warning: If set to OFF, this will stop scrolling in all windows
    and not reenable scrolling even if you set it back to ON. (You
    need to manually scroll to the bottom in each window first.)
</dd>

<dt>window_auto_change = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Turn this on to automatically switch to newly-created windows.
    This may cause you to misdirect messages, so be careful.

</dd>

<dt>beep_when_window_active = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Should beeps be noisy in a window you're watching?  Perhaps not,
    since you are theoretically watching that window.  You ARE
    watching it, aren't you?
</dd>

<dt>activity_hide_level =</dt>
<dd>
    Message levels that don't count towards channel activity.  That
    is, channels won't be marked as &quot;active&quot; if messages of these
    types appear.

</dd>

<dt>show_own_nickchange_once = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Squash your own nick-change messages so they appear only once, not
    once in every window you have on that network.
</dd>

<dt>reuse_unused_windows = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When set on, irssi will reuse unused windows when looking for a
    new window to put something in.  Otherwise unused windows are
    ignored, and new ones are always created.
</dd>

<dt>colors = ON</dt>

<dd>
    Enable or disable colors.
</dd>

<dt>term_force_colors = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Always display colors, even when the terminal type says colors
    aren't supported.  Useful for working around really dumb
    terminals.
</dd>

<dt>autofocus_new_items = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Switch the focus to a new item when it's created.  This may be
    disturbing at first when combined with query window auto-creation,
    and it may be downright dangerous if it causes you to accidentally
    misdirect messages.

</dd>
</dl>

<h3>[misc]</h3>

<dl>
<dt>opermode =</dt>
<dd>
    When set, irssi will set your modes to match opermode when you

    The maximum number of users that may be in a channel for Irssi to
    issue a
	<pre><code>/who #channel</code></pre>
    in order to obtain the hostmasks of every participant.</dd>
<dd>
    If this is set too high, IRC servers might kick you for &quot;Sendq
    exceeded&quot;.

</dd>

<dt>recode_autodetect_utf8 = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Introduced in 0.8.10.</dd>
<dd>
    Irssi's recode system is broken.  This tries to cover up for it by
    leaving messages intact that seem to decode fine as Unicode UTF-8.
</dd>

<dt>lag_check_time = 1min</dt>
<dd>
    How long to wait between active lag checks.  Irssi will passively
    check for lag when you're active, but sometimes it's necessary to
    actively check.  This is the minimum amount of time between active
    checks.

</dd>

<dd>
    Default message to send when /quit'ting.
</dd>

<dt>paste_detect_time = 5msecs</dt>

<dt>ctcp_userinfo_reply = $Y</dt>
<dd>

    The reply to send when someone queries your user information.  By
    default, it's &quot;$Y&quot;, which is defined by the real_name setting.</dd>
<dd>
    See <a href="http://irssi.org/documentation/variables">Docs on Special Variables</a> for more special
    variables you can use.
</dd>

<dd>
    Introduced in 0.8.10.</dd>
<dd>
    Irssi will try to concatenate multiple lines into a single lined
    message when these lines have the same indentation level and
    &quot;look&quot; like they were copied out of Irssi.</dd>

<dd>
    It's useful for quoting e-mail or other large-text messages, but
    it will probably bite you if you try to pasted indented text, such
    as code listings.  Irssi will join multiple lines of code,
    destroying any structure you wanted to preserve.
</dd>

<dt>channel_sync = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Set whether irssi should synchronize a channel on join.  When
    enabled, irssi will gather extra information about a channel:

</dd>

<dt>paste_detect_keycount = 5</dt>
<dd>
    Introduced in 0.8.10.</dd>

<dd>
    TODO - What's this?
</dd>

<dt>recode_fallback = CP1252</dt>
<dd>
    Introduced in 0.8.10.</dd>
<dd>
    If you have Irssi compiled with recode support and Irssi believes
    that a message you received did not recode properly in your
    terminal default character set (or the specified one), it will
    recode the message using this character set.</dd>
<dd>
    (CP1252, the irssi default, is the Microsoft(R) Windows default
    character set for Western Europe.)</dd>

<dd>
    Also see /help recode for more details about recoding.
</dd>

<dt>notify_idle_time = 1hour</dt>
<dd>
    Irssi will notify you when someone you're watching becomes idle
    for this long.
</dd>

<dt>massjoin_max_joins = 3</dt>
<dd>
    If nonzero, detect mass joins.  A mass join is when someone joins
    more than massjoin_max_joins per massjoin_max_wait seconds.</dd>

<dd>
    TODO - Or is this when more than massjoin_max_joins people join
    per massjoin_max_wait seconds, regardless of the user mask?
</dd>

<dt>write_buffer_size = 0</dt>
<dd>
    Amount of text (logs, etc) to buffer in memory before writing to
    disk.  Useful for minimizing disk access.
</dd>

<dt>write_buffer_timeout = 0</dt>

    disk if the text in it is this old, even if the buffer isn't full.</dd>

<dd>
    Useful in conjunction with really large write_buffer_size values,
    to prevent a lot of text from being lost if irssi crashes or is
    killed.
</dd>

<dt>STATUS_OPER = *</dt>
<dd>
    TODO - What's this?
</dd>

<dt>recode = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Introduced in 0.8.10.</dd>

    if you prefer your messages not being messed with.
</dd>

<dt>ban_type = normal</dt>
<dd>
    The default ban type to use: normal, user, host, domain, custom?
    See &quot;/help ban&quot; for a description of ban types.
</dd>

<dt>lag_max_before_disconnect = 5min</dt>

<dd>
    Irssi detects your lag and will reconnect you automatically if
    your lag exceeds this value.
</dd>

<dt>part_message =</dt>
<dd>
    Default message to send when parting a channel.
</dd>

<dt>auto_whowas = ON</dt>

</dd>

<dt>paste_verify_line_count = 5</dt>
<dd>
    Ask you whether you meant to paste something if it's longer than
    this many lines.
</dd>

<dt>max_wildcard_modes = 6</dt>
<dd>
    When set nonzero, don't mass op/deop/kick more than this many
    people.  Commands that let you do things to other nicks can take
    wildcards.  For example
	<pre><code>/kick floodbot* flooding</code></pre>
</dd>

<dd>
    would kick everybody whose nickname began with &quot;floodbot&quot;.  Unless
    there were more than max_wildcard_modes of them.</dd>
<dd>
    This setting prevents you from embarassment like:
	<pre><code>/kick *</code></pre>
</dd>
<dd>
    You can specify &quot;-yes&quot; if you really want to do it:
	<pre><code>/kick -yes *</code></pre>

</dd>

<dt>hide_netsplit_quits = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Don't display quit messages if they're the product of a netsplit.

    See /help knockout

</dd>

<dt>massjoin_max_wait = 5000</dt>
<dd>
    The amount of time to watch for mass-joins.</dd>
<dd>
    I'm not sure which unit of time is used to measure
    massjoin_max_wait.
</dd>

<dt>lag_min_show = 1sec</dt>
<dd>
    Lag is a part of life on IRC.  Don't bother displaying lag that's
    below this threshold, presumably because you consider it to be
    insignificant.

</dd>

<dt>wall_format = [Wall/$0] $1-</dt>
<dd>
    Format for wall messages.</dd>
<dt>netsplit_nicks_hide_threshold = 15</dt>

<dd>
    TODO - Does this still work even?</dd>
<dt>group_multi_mode = ON</dt>

<dd>
    Introduced in 0.8.10.</dd>
<dd>
    The outgoing character set you want your messags to be recoded
    into, if different from your term_charset.</dd>
<dt>cmdchars = /</dt>
<dd>
    Prefix characters that tell irssi that your input is a command
    rather than chat text.</dd>
<dt>notify_whois_time = 5min</dt>

<dd>
    How often to check /whois on a user who's online, to see if their
    /away or idle status changes.</dd>
<dt>kick_first_on_kickban = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    Kickban will normally ban first, then kick.  Turn this option on
    to reverse the situation, which can create a race condition if the
    user rejoins between your kick and the subsequent ban.</dd>
<dt>recode_transliterate = ON</dt>
<dd>
    Introduced in 0.8.10.</dd>
<dd>

    If enabled, irssi tells iconv to try and replace characters that
    don't recode well with similar looking ones that exist in the
    target character set.

    activity as abuse.</dd>
<dt>resolve_reverse_lookup = OFF</dt>
<dd>
    When connecting, resolve the server's IP address back into its
    hostname.  Probably useful for figuring out exactly which server
    you're on after resolving a round-robin host.

  ssl_cafile =
  ssl_cert =
  ssl_pkey =
  ssl_verify = OFF
  use_ssl = OFF</dd>

    and song lyrics. :)</dd>
<dt>server_reconnect_time = 5min</dt>
<dd>

    How long to wait between reconnects to the same server.  Some
    servers will k-line you if you reconnect too quickly, so be
